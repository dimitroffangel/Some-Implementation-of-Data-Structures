# Some-Implementation-of-Data-Structures


Basic idea of the repository is to implement interesting for me data structures, that I have not stumbled upon and are some kind of a 
polymorphism between existing ones, but with some kind of a usefullness.

Right now I have built a XORList and I'm planning to build some times a pool allocator, using a linkedList, which from its side of
low - level details is dependant on a sequential array...
